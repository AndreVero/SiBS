# SIBS
**This is a pet project that I going to use for playing with top-notch solutions of SDLC.**
The final software architecture can make an impression of an overcomplicated solution, bat it was made for a sake of very low coupling. 
Finally, it should be a peaty easy task to replace persistence approaches, in-app component communication, serialization/DI mechanisms, etc.

# Implemented tasks:
1. App quality:
 * Try TDD approach; 
 * Try from top to button code writing;
2. Architectures:
* Implement MVVM;
* Modularization
3. DI:
*  Hilt
4. Threading. Simultaneous execution. Task ordering:
*  Coroutines
