This is a pet project that I going to use for playing with top-notch solutions of SDLC.
The final software architecture can make an impression of an overcomplicated solution, bat it was made for a sake of very low coupling. 
Finally, it should be a peaty easy task to replace persistence approaches, in-app component communication, serialization/DI mechanisms, etc.

Implemented tasks:
App quality:
•  Try TDD approach; 
•  Try from top to button code writing;
•  
Architectures:
•  Implement MVVM;
•  Modularization
DI:
•  Hilt
Threading. Simultaneous execution. Task ordering:
•  Coroutines
